## ?? OOP Concepts Demonstrated

### Lab01 - Encapsulation & The Duplication Problem
**Core Concepts:**
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields, public properties, method organization
- **Constructor patterns**: Object initialization with parameters
- **Method design**: Public interface vs private implementation
- **State management**: Animation states, physics state tracking

**The Problem:**
- Identical code in multiple classes (300+ duplicate lines)
- Maintenance nightmare (bugs need fixing in multiple places)
- Violation of DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- No code reuse despite identical functionality

### Lab02 - Simple Inheritance & Code Reuse
**Core Concepts:**
- **Inheritance basics**: `class Samurai : Shinobi`
- **Constructor chaining**: `base(name, x, y)`
- **Method inheritance**: Automatic availability of parent methods
- **Smart polymorphism**: `this.GetType().Name` for dynamic behavior

**The Solution:**
- 90% code reduction in child class
- Automatic sprite loading based on class name
- Single point of maintenance in base class
- Basic polymorphism with unified handling

**Limitations Revealed:**
- Cannot customize individual behaviors easily
- All characters behave identically
- Rigid inheritance structure

### Lab03 - Virtual Methods & Behavior Customization
**Core Concepts:**
- **Virtual methods**: `virtual` keyword for overrideable methods
- **Method overriding**: `override` keyword for custom implementations
- **Polymorphism in action**: Same call, different behaviors
- **this vs base**: Explicit object and parent references

**Advanced Features:**
- Different character speeds and powers
- Mana system demonstration (Fighter class)
- Runtime behavior differences with identical interfaces
- Keywords demonstration: `this.Mana`, `base.Attack()`

**Student Revelation:**
- Same method signature, completely different results
- Easy to add new character types
- Customization without breaking base functionality

### Lab04 - Abstract Classes & Interface Contracts
**Core Concepts:**
- **Abstract classes**: Cannot instantiate, forces implementation
- **Abstract methods**: Must be implemented by derived classes
- **Interfaces**: Contracts for specific capabilities
- **Multiple inheritance**: Class + Interface combinations
- **Runtime type checking**: `is` operator for polymorphic casting

**Advanced Patterns:**
- **Single polymorphic reference**: `Character character`
- **Dynamic instantiation**: `character = new Samurai(...)`
- **Interface polymorphism**: `if (character is IShieldable shield)`
- **Type-specific features**: `if (character is Fighter fighter)`

**Ultimate Flexibility:**
- Force implementation of core methods (abstract)
- Optional capabilities through interfaces
- Runtime behavior modification
- Perfect separation of concerns
